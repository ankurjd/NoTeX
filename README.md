# NoTeX
Math handwriting conversion and solver

Uses machine learning to convert handwritten mathematical expressions into LaTeX, then uses Nerdamer API to solve them.



 The name NoTeX can be interpreted in two ways:

    1: No TeX. I personally hate writing LaTeX.

    2: Note-X, because it can be used to take mathematical notes.
